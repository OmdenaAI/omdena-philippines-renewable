# Task Folder Details

Note : Please Follow the below guidelines to create task folders
- Task Folder Naming Convention : _task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)_  ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
- All Task folder names should be in chronologial order (from 1 to n)
- All Task folders should have a README.md file with task Details and task goals along with an info table containing all code/notebook files with their links and information
- Task folders that contain sub-tasks can create sub folders within the task.
- __Update the below table explaining the task details.__
